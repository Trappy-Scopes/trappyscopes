"""
General-purpose file-sync primitives: mount a share, run rsync.

Not experiment- or config-specific. Both `ExpSync` (syncing experiment data)
and the launcher's config-sync utility (syncing the trappyverse/ folder) need
"connect to a share, transfer files" -- this is the one place that logic
lives, so it only has to be gotten right once.

Shells out to the real `rsync` binary rather than a third-party Python rsync
package: rsync already handles archive mode, compression, update-only,
delta-transfer and dry-run as plain CLI flags, and this codebase already had
working precedent doing exactly this (the old ExpSync.sync_file) before this
module existed.

This file replaces a previous, dead `SyncEngine` class here that imported a
`config.common` module which does not exist anywhere in this repository and
was never actually invoked by anything live.

## AI Generated -- rclone transport (docs/notes/sync_rework.md §5). rclone speaks
## the remote protocol directly, so nothing here needs an OS-level mount: no
## /Volumes-vs-/mnt branch, no `sudo mount`, no pre-creating remote directories,
## and no sudo in the transfer path at all -- remote writes happen as the
## authenticated remote user. The rsync helpers below are kept for the
## launcher's trappyverse/ config sync, which genuinely does work on a local
## folder pair; ExpSync no longer uses them.
