"""
Device tree: what's physically attached to this machine right now --
serial ports, USB devices, keyboard/mouse, and displays. Read-only
introspection, same shape as platform.py's @fact registry: each
category is collected independently via a `_CATEGORIES` registry, and
a failing collector doesn't take the rest down with it.

No single library enumerates all of this across OSes, so this follows
the OS instead of fighting it -- same call as install_native() in
core/installer/environment.py: pyserial's list_ports is genuinely
cross-platform and used for serial; everything else is macOS
(system_profiler, already on every Mac) or Linux (/sys, /proc --
already on every Linux, no extra dependency), with no attempt made on
other platforms.

Deliberately shows only what's *currently present*, not history --
e.g. macOS Bluetooth pairings that aren't connected right now are
dropped (device_connected only, never device_not_connected), since a
device tree meant to be read at a glance is exactly what gets crowded
out by every accessory ever paired.

The macOS USB/input parsing (system_profiler's JSON shape) and the
Linux paths (/sys/bus/usb/devices, /proc/bus/input/devices,
/sys/class/drm) were checked against real output on this Mac and
against documented sysfs/procfs formats respectively -- the Linux
paths have not been verified against real Linux hardware in this
session (same caveat as the Jetson hardware profile).
